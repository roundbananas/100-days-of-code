//create an array of projectiles and initialise their start and target positions
//1. Engine.h - declare a vertexarray: VertexArray m_ProjectileTargetArray; and a pointer CanonProjectile* projectiles = nullptr;
//2. engine.cpp - pass m_ProjectileTargetArray and m_canonArrayDigital (which is the start positions for the projectiles) to CreateProjectiles.cpp, by reference
//3. CreateProjectiles.cpp
//- create vertex array for targets
//- declare projectile array using new keyword
//- position and spawn each projectile by passing a intermediary position variable to the spawn function
//4. when we need to see the projectile, we'll draw it in render() and update it in update()
