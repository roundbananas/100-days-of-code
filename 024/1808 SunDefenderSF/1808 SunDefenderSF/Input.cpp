//The game has 5 buttons. In playing mode they are used to fire each of the five canons. In Levelling_Up mode they are used to make power-up selections. In Game_Over and Idle mode, pressing any button will start a new game.
//There are two ways to get input. Events seem to be most appropriate.
//Events notify you when something happens ("this button was pressed", "the mouse has moved") - syntax "(event.type == sf::Event::KeyPressed)". (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/window-events.php) At this stage I think tracking button presses as Events will be enough for this game.
//The other type of input I could grab (using SFML) is real-time input (ie is a key CURRENTLY being pressed) - syntax "sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Left)". (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/window-inputs.php) This might be useful if I want the player to be able to hold down a button for rapid fire.
