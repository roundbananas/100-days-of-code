YEAAH!H!H!H!H!H!H!

Wizard's Wrath program is working (no sound yet).
Very rough but totally playable.

Need to tidy up the way text is displayed (size, font, line breaks).
Then playtest.
Then add some sound and playtest some more.

WOO!

Big coding wins. Every project I embark on seems to be harder than I imagine it'll be.
